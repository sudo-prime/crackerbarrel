Python module for playing and solving the cracker barrel puzzle both manually and automatically.

## Getting Started

 To enter manual mode (for playing the game yourself!) simply run `python crackerbarrel.py` in a terminal.
 
 Optionally, you can inclue the flags:
 
 `--solve, -s`: Takes optional positional argument n which is 1 by default. Finds nth solution.
 
 `--all, -a`: Finds and counts all 1-peg solutions. May take a little while to run.
